<h2>About Us</h2>


<h3>The Collaborators</h3>


<p>
In late 2019, a small but passionate international collaboration came together to deliver a powerful and innovative image data management platform to support the study and conservation of African Carnivores.
</p>

<p>
<strong>Tech 4 Conservation (T4C)</strong> - a Canadian non-profit, launched in 2020 with a focussed mission: empowering wildlife conservationists through groundbreaking AI technology. What began as a mission to protect African carnivores has evolved into ArgusWild AI, our platform that now spans five continents: from the Americas and Europe, to Africa and Asia.</a>
